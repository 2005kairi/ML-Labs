This lab explored the Online Retail dataset, which contains transaction records from December 2009 to December 2011.
The work began with essential data‑cleaning steps, including handling missing values, removing invalid entries such as
negative quantities, and creating a Revenue feature to support deeper analysis. As part of the EDA process, the dataset
was examined for structure, basic statistics, and early patterns to establish a clear understanding before moving into more
detailed exploration. The analysis focused on understanding customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and overall
sales patterns across the two‑year period. Key variables such as quantity, price, and revenue were reviewed to identify 
top‑selling products, major contributing countries, and general sales trends. A set of visualizations was included to highlight
important relationships within the data, including a Revenue Heatmap by Month and Day of Week that revealed temporal patterns 
in purchasing activity.
Overall, the lab provided a solid overview of the dataset through exploratory data analysis,highlighting its structure, key patterns,
and the relationships revealed during the EDA process.
