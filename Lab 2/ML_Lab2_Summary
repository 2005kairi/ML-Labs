The diabetes dataset contains medical information about Pima Indian women aged 21 and older. Each row represents one patient and includes diagnostic features such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree 
function, and age. The target variable, Outcome, shows whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0). This is a binary classification problem, where the goal is to classify patients as diabetic or non‑diabetic based on their medical measurements. The model learns 
patterns in these features and uses them to predict the likelihood of diabetes for new patients. For this project, the dataset was downloaded from Kaggle as a CSV file, imported and explored in Jupyter Notebook, and the workflow was illustrated using a methodology 
diagram created in draw.io.
